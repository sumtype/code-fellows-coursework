# React CRUD Application - Server

This is the server side of the React CRUD application.  To run the server enter the command `node server.js` in your console window when navigated within this directory.  This server uses MongoDB for it's database operations, so you must concurrently run a MongoDB instance which this server can access when using this server.  Additionally, you must call `npm install` in your console window while navigated within this directory for the server to work.
