##Description
Create an express server to serve up your client side application, 
remember that this is a different application than your server side 
application and hence has a different "server". 

Create separate app and build folders. 

Create a gulpfile that will both copy static html files from app 
to build and create a webpack bundle.

Create a client side app using webpack that displays the current time
and updates that time every second. Use whatever tools you want, I recommend
[moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)
